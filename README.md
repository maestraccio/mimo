# mimo
Money In, Money Out <s>is</s> was a Housekeeping Book / Budget Planner written in Python for command line
Edit 20240225: Code is working but ugly, needs serious cleanup
Edit 20240331: For the impatient: I am rewriting the whole thing - a better solution than a cleanup. Wait for the first version of "mimosasa": "Money In, Money Out: Spendings And Savings Aid", but don't stay up
Edit 20240428: The first Beta version of mimosasa is in my repo. It is not complete yet (Savings are missing) and still under heavy construction (multiple dayly commits) but ready for testing. Please send suggestions
